<h3>This is the sidebar</h3>

  <!-- 
    We use two-way binding that modifys the number of guests directly in the model 
    This is very convinient when for quickly getting a interactive app. However, 
    if you want more control and data validation, you should still use instead
    the event handlers, e.g. (keyup)="setNumberOfGuests"
  -->
  People: <input [(ngModel)]="dinnerService.numberOfGuests"/>
  <br>
  Total number of guests: {{dinnerService.numberOfGuests}}
